						<td>This Live Action Cinderella is an adaptation of its 1950 cartoon version. It is the origin of all typical princess stories with the evil step-mother, and step-sisters, with meeting a prince and going back to reality on midnight. But a little remembrance of the girl, of the prince's dream and eventually, they will find each other and fall in love. Wouldn't it be exciting to see the mix of the modern world with a story from YEARS ago? And with such a great production? </td>

						<td>We all know about Sleeping Beauty where the princess falls into a deep sleep and is woken by the Prince's kiss. But do you know the side of the "villain" who cursed the lovely princess? Well watch this Live-Action movie of Maleficent to be able to know both sides to be able to see and know both sides of the story.</td>
